# Tic-Tak-Toe
A simple tic-tak-toe game, cretaed in pure C. I had created it just for fun. (in ~2013 when I was learning C, CPP).

[Download](https://github.com/MaulikRaviya/Tic-Tak-Toe/releases/download/v1.0/tic.tak.toe.exe) and Run the EXE file on Windows.

Or compile the "tic tak toe.C" file to build executable file for other platforms.
